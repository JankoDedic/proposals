<h1><a name="title">Fixing <code>Relation</code>s</a></h1>

<h2><a name="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This paper proposes changing the <code>Relation</code> and related concepts, to achieve following goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>zero overhead</em>: uses of range version of standard algorithm shall not be less effective than hand written code,
                              especially it cannot be less effective than STL1 counterparts,</li>
  <li><em>generality</em>: concepts should be usable both in case of algorithms and containers, they should map to the underlying 
                           mathematical concepts and avoid imposing additional requirement,</li>
  <li><em>soundness</em>: the syntactic requirements of the algorithm should allow (runtime) check if supplied object satisfies
                          associated semantic requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The secondary goal is to simplify migration to the rangified version of algorithms, however reaching of this goal should 
   not undermine above properties.</p>

<p>This paper argues that the currently specified concept does not achieve above goal, due the additional requirement of <code>CommonReference</code>
   for types of parameters. As consequence we propose to relax this concept (and all derived concepts) by removing above requirement.</p>

<p>The need for appying this change, was recognized with the inception of the current concept design - similiar change is already proposed as alternative
   design in Appendinx D.2 Cross-type Concepts of <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3351.pdf">A Concept Design for the STL</a> (The Palo Alto report) paper.<p>

<h2><a name="motivation">3. Motivation and Scope</a></h2>

<p>Family of the standard algorithms related to sorting and operations on sorted sequence (<code>sort</code>, <code>lower_bound</code>, <code>set_intersection</code>, ...)
   are accepting an functor, that is representing a <em>weak ordering</em>. Examples of such ordering, includes relation resulting from a composition of the <em>key function</em>
   that extracts certain part of the object, and the <em>strong ordering</em> relation over extracted part.</p>
   
<p>To illustrate lets us consider following <code>NameLess</code> functor, that is comparing object of <code>Employee</code> by
   comparing only <code>name</code> member:</p>
<pre>struct NameLess
{
   bool operator()(Employee const&amp; lhs, Employee const&amp; rhs) const
   { return lhs.name &lt; rhs.name; }

   bool operator()(Employee const&amp; lhs, std::string_view rhs) const
   { return lhs.name &lt; rhs; }

   bool operator()(std::string_view lhs, Employee const&amp; rhs) const
   { return lhs &lt; rhs.name; }

   bool operator()(std::string_view lhs, std::string_view rhs) const
   { return lhs &lt; rhs; }
};</pre> 

<p>Having above functor, we may sort a vector <code>ve</code> of the <code>Employee</code> object by name:</p>
<pre>std::sort(ve.begin(), ve.end(), NameLess{});</pre>
<p>Now that code can be upgraded to use Ranges:</p>
<pre>std::ranges::sort(ve.begin(), ve.end(), NameLess{});
std::ranges::sort(ve, NameLess{});</pre>
<p>Finally we have an option to provide our <em>key function</em> and <em>strong ordering</em> separately:</p>
<pre>std::ranges::sort(ve, std::less&lt;&gt;{}, &amp;Employee::name);</pre>

<p>Once the vector is sorted, we can use one of the other algorithms to find all employee's with given name
   (i.e. find <em>equivalence class</em> for given value):</p>
<pre>std::equal_range(ve.begin(), ve.end(), "Kowalski"sv, NameLess{});</pre>
<p>However, if we want to migrate the above code to Ranges, by stating:</p>
<pre>std::ranges::equal_range(ve.begin(), ve.end(), "Kowalski"sv, NameLess{});
std::ranges::equal_range(ve, "Kowalski"sv, NameLess{});</pre>
<p>The above invocations will not compile, and we will be forced to rewrite my functor into separate
   projection and comparison:</p>
<pre>std::ranges::equal_range(ve, "Kowalski"sv, std::less&lt;&gt;{}, &amp;Employee::name);</pre>

<p>The above compilation problem is caused by the fact that for the relation to satisfy <code>StrictWeakOrdering&lt;NameLess, Employee, std::string_view&gt;</code>,
   such functor needs to satisfy <code>Relation&lt;NameLess, Employee, std::string_view&gt;</code>, which requires that the types <code>Employee</code> and 
   <code>std::string_view</code> has a common reference (<code>CommonReference&lt;Employee, std::string_view&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>In situation when <em>weak ordering</em> is defined in terms of the composition of the <em>key function</em> and <em>strong ordering</em>, the type
   returned by <em>key function</em> may be unrelated to the actual object type, as we are usually returning an member of that object. This means
   that the user is forced to rewrite they comparators into separate projection and homogeneous functor. 
   This puts an arbitrary limitation on the implementation freedom, and have negative consequences both on runtime performance of the code
   and its readability.</p>

<h3><a name="motivation.cost">3.1. Inefficient abstraction</a></h3>

<p>To illustrate the effect of above limitation, lets us consider the following problem: We have a <code>vector&lt;Itinerary&gt;</code>
   representing round-trip flights (to specific destination and back), and we want to find ones that are having departures
   on specific dates.</p>

<p>Firstly we defined the required comparators, <code>LegDepartureDateLess</code> compares departure date on leg, while <code>ItneraryDepartureDatesLess</code>
   compares departures of all legs:</p>
<pre>struct LegDepartureDateLess
{
   bool operator()(Leg const&amp; lhs, Leg const&amp; rhs) const
   { return lhs.departureDate &lt; rhs.departureDate; }

   bool operator()(Leg const&amp; lhs, std::chrono::local_days const&amp; rhs) const
   { return lhs.departureDate &lt; rhs; }

   bool operator()(std::chrono::local_days const&amp; lhs, Leg const&amp; rhs) const
   { return lhs &lt; rhs.departureDate; }

   bool operator()(std::chrono::local_days const&amp; lhs, std::chrono::local_days const&amp; rhs) const
   { return lhs &lt; rhs; }
};

struct ItineraryDepartureDatesLess
{
  bool operator()(Itinerary const&amp; lhs, Itinerary const&amp; rhs) const
  { return less_impl(lhs.legs, rhs.legs); }

  bool operator()(std::vector&lt;std::chrono::local_days&gt; const&amp; lhs, Itinerary const&amp; rhs) const
  { return less_impl(lhs, rhs.legs); }

  bool operator()(Itinerary const&amp; lhs, std::vector&lt;std::chrono::local_days&gt; const&amp; rhs) const
  { return less_impl(lhs.legs, rhs); }

  bool operator()(std::vector&lt;std::chrono::local_days&gt; const&amp; lhs, std::vector&lt;std::chrono::local_days&gt; const&amp; rhs) const
  { return less_impl(lhs, rhs); }
   
private:
  template&lt;typename Sequence1, typename Sequence2&gt;
  bool less_impl(Sequence1 const&amp; lhs, Sequence2 const&amp; rhs) const
  {
    return std::lexicographical_compare(lhs.begin(), lhs.end(),
                                        rhs.begin(), rhs.end(),
                                        LegDepartureDateLess{});
  }
};</pre>

<p>Given above comparison functions, we can sort the vector <code>vi</code> of <code>Itinerary</code>:</p>
<pre>std::sort(vi.begin(), vi.end(), ItineraryDepartureDatesLess{});</pre>
<p>After that we can search for specific set of departure dates (given as vector <code>vd</code>) in the logarithmic time:</p>
<pre>std::equal_range(vi.begin(), vi.end(), vd, ItineraryDepartureDatesLess{});</pre>

<p>If we want to implement the same functionality using the ranges, we can mechanically transform the code sorting elements:</p>
<pre>std::ranges::sort(vi, ItineraryDepartureDatesLess{});</pre>
<p>However such manual transformation will not work in case of if we want the search itineraries departing on specific dates (<code>std::vector&lt;std::chrono::local_days&gt;</code> <code>vd</code>):</p>
<pre>std::equal_range(vi, vd, ItineraryDepartureDatesLess{});</pre>
<p>will not compile, as (unsuprisingly) there is no common reference between the <code>Itinerary</code> and <code>std::vector&lt;std::chrono::local_days&gt;</code> &mdash;
   it will be ambiguous if <code>std::vector&lt;std::chrono::local_days&gt;</code> meant to represented departure or arrival dates of either
   all legs or all flights constituting given itinerary.</p>

<p>To fix above code, we need to split our comparator into separate projection and relation. In the first attempt we may define projection as follows:</p>
<pre>auto const toDepartureDates = [](Itinerary const&amp; i) -&gt; std::vector&lt;std::chrono::local_days&gt;
{ 
   std::vector&lt;std::chrono::local_days&gt; result(i.legs.size());
   std::ranges::transform(i.legs, result.begin(), &amp;Leg::departureDate);
   return result;
}</pre>

<p>For the comparator, we just need to invoke <code>lexicographical_compare</code> giving our following code:</p>
<pre>std::equal_range(vi, vd,
                 [](auto const&amp; lhs, auto const&amp; rhs) { return std::ranges::lexicographical_compare(lhs, rhs); },
                 toDepartureDates);</pre>
<p>The above code has a major drawback - for each comparison of elements (that is limited by O(n log n)) a temporary vector is created, leading
   to degradation of the code performance comparing to STL1 example.</p>

<p>This problem can be mitigated by returning a transform view from the <code>toDepartureDates</code> function, to reduce
   the cost of temporary production:</p>
<pre>auto const toDepartureDatesView = [](Itinerary const&amp; i) { return i.legs | ranges::view::transform(&amp;Leg::departureDate); };</pre>
<p>Firstly, there is still not guarantee that the code will have same performance as corresponding STL1 version - to achieve
   that the compiler will be required to completely eliminate creation of the view, and replace iteration view it with raw loop
   - in other words we are requiring on heroic optimization efforts on compiler side. 
   This is acknowledged  by range library author in <a href="http://ericniebler.com/2014/04/27/range-comprehensions/">"Performance" section of following post</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, this does not eliminate the problems caused by common reference requirement, just pushes is one level down.</p>
<pre>std::equal_range(vi, vd,
                 [](auto const&amp; lhs, auto const&amp; rhs) { return std::ranges::lexicographical_compare(lhs, rhs); },
                 toDepartureDatesView);</pre>
<p>In the above code provided lambda needs to satisfy <code>StrictWeakOrdering</code> on <code>std::vector&lt;std::chrono::local_days&gt;</code>
   and <code>TransformView</code> (result of <code>toDepartureDateView</code>), which means that common reference between these two
   types needs to exists. This happens to be true for this specific case, as all proposed views are convertible to 
   containers, however if we modify the example to use <code>std::span&lt;std::chrono::local_days&gt;</code>
   instead of <code>std::vector&lt;std::chrono::local_days&gt;</code> the code will again fail to compile,
   as there is no common reference for different views - this specialization also cannot be defined
   by user.</p>

<p>As presented in above requirements, the implementation options limitation imposed by requiring an <code>CommonReference</code>
   for orderings, is negatively impacting the performance in the resulting code. This is true even in situation when view are used 
   - user would be require to really on optimization to achieve same performance.
   In authors opinion, this means that current design of Ranges are breaking zero-overhead principle, that is backbone of
   C++ language - the user is able the implement same functionality in more efficient manner, by simply using older version
   of algorithms, that was not imposing such limitation.</p>

<h3><a name="motivation.sound">3.2. Mathematical soundness</a></h3>

<p>One of the arguments for the introduction of the <code>CommonReference</code> requirement, is that it is <b>required</b>
   to make <code>StrictWeakOrdering</code> mathematically sound. The definition of soundness is a bit subjective, but to counteract the argument,
   the author proposes following approach: The concept is considered to be sound, if it:
   <ul>
     <li>semantic requirements are consistent with the semantic requirements of the underlying mathematical definition,</li>
     <li>syntactic requirements allow above semantic requirement to be verified in code (if necessary at runtime).</li>
   </ul>
</p>

<p>In our case we are interested in the definition of the <em>weak ordering</em> over some domain <em>X</em>. The mathematical
   definition of <em>weak ordering</em> requires following axioms to be true:
   <ul>
     <li><em>irreflexivity</em>: for all <code>t</code> in <em>X</em>: <code>!r(t, t)</code></li>
     <li><em>asymmetry</em>: for all <code>t</code>, <code>u</code> in <em>X</em>: <code>r(t, u)</code> =&gt; <code>!r(u, t)</code></li>
     <li><em>transitivity</em>: for all <code>t</code>, <code>u</code>, <code>z</code> in <em>X</em>: <code>r(t, u) &amp;&amp; r(u, z)</code> =&gt; <code>r(t, z)</code></li>
     <li><em>transitivity of incomparability</em>: for all <code>t</code>, <code>u</code>, <code>z</code> in <em>X</em>: <code>(!r(t, u) &amp;&amp; !r(u, t)) &amp;&amp; (!r(u, z) &amp;&amp; !r(z, u))</code> =&gt; <code>(!r(t, z) &amp;&amp; !r(z, t))</code></li>
   </ul>
</p>

<p>The last requirement is necessary to show that the function <code>eq(x, y)</code> equivalent to <code>!r(x, y) &amp;&amp; !r(y, x)</code> is an equivalence relation,
   i.e. the relation is <em>reflexive</em> (guaranteed by <em>irreflexivity</em> of <code>r</code>),  <em>symmetric</em> (from definition), and <em>transitive</em> (imposed 
   directly by <em>transitivity of incomparability</em> for <code>r</code>). 
   This guarantee that for any <code>t</code>, <code>u</code> in the <em>X</em> only one of following is true:  <code>r(x, y)</code>,  <code>eq(x, y)</code>, <code>r(y, x)</code>,
   where <code>eq</code> is equality relation. 
   That means that <code>r</code> also satisfies definition of <em>weak ordering</em> presented in section "4.2 Total and Weak Orderings" of "Elements of Programming" by Alexander Stepanov and Paul McJones.</p>

<p>To verify if given functor <code>f</code> is strict weak ordering over an domain consisting of object of type <code>T</code> and of type <code>U</code> 
   (note that domain is just set of elements, which may be on different type), we will require following invocation to be well-formed:
   <code>f(t, u)</code>, <code>f(u, t)</code>, <code>f(t, t)</code>, <code>f(u, u)</code>, where <code>t</code> is object of type <code>T</code> and <code>u</code>
   of type <code>U</code>.</p>

<p>In summary, neither the semantic requirement of the <em>weak ordering</em> nor the syntactic requirement imposed by them require existence 
   of the common reference (common type) for the objects in the domain. As consequence the definition of <code>StrictWeakOrdering</code> that
   does not impose <code>CommonReference</code> is equally sound as current definition.</p>

</p>Furthermore introduction of such additional requirement is limiting the generality of the underlying algorithms (as can work with any <em>weak ordering</em>)
     which is step against ideas of generic programming.</p>

<h3><a name="motivation.set">3.3. Tailored for algorithms</a></h3>

<p>The current definition of the <code>StrictWeakOrdering</code>, was coined in the context of its usage with newly proposed
   range version of standard algorithms, that accept separate relation and projection arguments. 
   This reasoning, misses other standard library components, that also accepts the comparators. This is especially important
   in case of ordered containers (<code>set</code>, <code>map</code>) that are accepting an <em>weak ordering</em> as comparator,
   and were expanded with heterogeneous lookup (<code>is_transparent</code> nested typename).</p>

<p>To illustrate, lets us consider following example, we want to have mapping from the employee's name to the full object, the easiest
   approach would be to use following map:</p>
<pre>std::map&lt;std::string, Employee&gt; nameMap;</pre>
<p>The drawback of above solution is that the name of the employee is held twice in the structure, once as the key, and once inside the
   object. To mitigate the problem, we could construct an <code>set</code> of <code>Employee</code> that compares only its name, i.e.</p>
<pre>std::set&lt;Employee, NameLess&gt; nameSet;</pre> 
<p>In addition we can allow queering <code>nameSet</code> by the actual names, by adding <code>is_transparent</code> nested typedef
   to the <code>NameLess</code> comparator. This solution esentially removes the value duplication.</p>

<p>Note that if the set definition would be changed, so the provided comparator is required to satisfy <code>StrictWeakOrdering</code>
   the code will no longer compile due the <code>CommonReference</code> requirement - this is same situation as in case of
   <code>equal_range</code> example presented in first paragraph.
   As consequence, constraining the ordered containers with current <code>StrictWeakOrdering</code> concept, will de-facto
   remove functionality of heterogeneous lookup from ordered associative containers.</p> 

<p>Of course, it would be possible to introduce an second concept that would be used for ordered containers, however creating
   multiple concepts representing the same mathematical concept (<em>weak ordering</em>) is against Design Ideas (section 1.3) 
   presented in the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3351.pdf">The Palo Alto report</a>: limiting
   number of concepts and providing concept representing general idea in the domain.</p>

<h3><a name="motivation.common_reference">3.4. Hacking <code>common_reference</code></a></h3>

<p>It may be pointed out that the examples presented above as "not working", may be fixed by provding the <code>common_reference</code>
   for the compared type. As the compared types may be unrelated (one is subobject is the other), provided specialization,
   will not have expected semantics of common type - once the <code>Employee</code> will be reduced to only its name,
   it cannot be reconstructed back.</p>

<p>To illustrate lets as return to our <code>NameLess</code> example, presented at beginning of this section. For the code
   to compile, we need to make sure that the <code>CommonReference&lt;Employee, std::string_view&gt;</code> - to achieve
   that we may provide an implicit conversion from <code>Employee</code> to <code>std::string_view</code> that would return
   <code>name</code> member.</p>

<p>However, this solution is riddled with problems. Not only, it is introducing undesired conversion to the <code>std::string_view</code>
   that affects existing code, but fails in situation when we want to provide relation comparing other members of class <code>Employee</code>
   that has <code>std::string type</code>.
   For example, if we will want to write an second relation, <code>SurnameLess</code> that would compare the <code>surname</code> member of the
   <code>Employee</code> class, that also happen to have <code>std::string</code> type, we will also need to introduce the conversion to <code>std::string_view</code>
   that would return <code>surname</code> member, which directly conflicts with conversion we have provided to support <code>NameLess</code>.</p>

<p>[ Note: The conversion operators needs to return corresponding members of the <code>Employee</code>, to satisfy semantic requirements
   of the <code>Relation</code> concept, i.e:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>NameLess{}(e, sv)</code> (<code>e.name &lt; sv</code>), needs to be equivalent to <code>NameLess{}(std::string_view(e), sv)</code> (<code>std::string_view(e) &lt; sv</code>),</li>
  <li><code>SurnameLess{}(e, sv)</code> (<code>e.surname &lt; sv</code>), needs to be equivalent to <code>SurameLess{}(std::string_view(e), sv)</code> (<code>std::string_view(e) &lt; sv</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Above requirements cannot be both satisfied at the same time, as they require conversion from <code>Employee</code> to <code>std::string_view</code> to have different semantics. ]</p>

<p>We may attempt to mitigate need of implicit conversion, by providing an specialized common type for the <code>Employee</code> to <code>std::string_view</code>, for example:</p>
<pre>class EmployeeNameView
{
  EmployeeNameView(std::string_view s) : value(s) {}
  EmployeeNameView(Employee const&amp; e) : value(s.name) {}

  std::strong_ordering operator&lt;=&gt;(EmployeeNameView, EmployeeNameView) = default;

private:
  std::string_view value;
};</pre>
<p>End then provide an explicit specialization of <code>common_type</code> (or <code>basic_common_reference</code>) for <code>Employee</code> and <code>std::string_view</code>:</p>
<pre>namespace std
{
  template&lt;&gt;
  struct common_type&lt;Employee, std::string_view&gt;
  { using type = EmployeeNameView; };

  template&lt;&gt;
  struct common_type&lt;std::string_view, Employee&gt;
  { using type = EmployeeNameView; };
}</pre>

<p>Again this solution fails, if we will also want to introduce the <code>SurnameLess</code> relation. For these relation we need to specialize <code>common_type</code> for
   <code>Employee</code> and <code>std::string_view</code> to point to <code>EmployeeSurnameView</code> type, that is very similar to the <code>EmployeeNameView</code> with 
   one important difference - the construction of this type from <code>Employee</code> object need to store view to the <code>surname</code> member.
   This in the end leads to conflicting declaration of <code>common_type</code>, leading to same problem as in case of solution using conversion operator.
   Futhermore above solutions would not applicable, if the <code>NameLess</code> would accept <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;Employee&gt;</code> (or any other library wrapper
   specialized for <code>Employee</code>), as we cannot specialize <code>common_type</code> or <code>common_reference</code> for types that are not user defined. 
   Which means we cannot use it to allow lookups into <code>vector</code> of optionals or smart pointers.</p>

<p>As we need to provide different <code>common_type</code> specialization for comparison with either <code>name</code> and <code>surname</code>, 
   the other solution is to use an different type to represent such object, so instead of using <code>std::string_view</code> to represent above values,
   we will use specialized object (like above <code>EmployeeNameView</code> and <code>EmployeeSurnameView</code>) when search for value, so instead 
   of:</p>
<pre>std::equal_range(ve.begin(), ve.end(), "Kowalski"sv, NameLess{});</pre>
<p>we will write</p>
<pre>std::equal_range(ve.begin(), ve.end(), EmployeeNameView("Kowalski"));</pre>
<p>Note that we not longer need to provide an comparator object, as <code>Employee</code> are comparable with <code>EmployeeNameView</code>, due
   the existence of implicit conversion. Essentially this solution replaces custom comparison functor (which can be created using lambda)
   with custom type.</p>

<p>Finally we could drop any attempts to provide an semantically meaningful type for the <code>CommonReference</code> and define <code>common_type</code> to be
   an variant of the <code>std::variant&lt;Employee, std::string_view&gt;</code> (or <code>basic_common_type</code>  to return <code>variant</code> of references).
   Of course this workaround cannot be applied in case of relation accepting standard-library types specialized for user-defined type. 
   Furthermore it unnecessary complicates the definition of the relation operators, as they need to able to compare variant object with correct semantic.</p>

<p>In contrast to previous sections, when we were unable to implement desired ordering (or implement it effectively), in this section
   we will discuss the example ordering, that cannot be used as comparator, due existing specialization of <code>common_type</code>.</p>

<p>Let us consider implementing an <code>MathematicalLess</code> functor, that will compare class of integral types, according
   to mathematical meaning of this relation, i.e. <code>MathematicalLess{}(-1, 1u)</code> return <code>true</code>. We may
   implement it as follows:</p>
<pre>struct MathematicalLess
{
  template&lt;typename T, typename U&gt;
  bool operator()(T t, U u) const
  {
     using UT = std::make_unsigned_t&lt;T&gt;;
     using UU = std::make_unsigned_t&lt;U&gt;;
     if constexpr (std::is_signed_v&lt;T&gt; == std::is_signed_v&lt;U&gt;) // types has same signdess
       return t &lt; u;
     else if constexpr (std::is_signed_v&lt;T&gt;) // U is unsigned
       return t &lt; 0 ? true : UT(t) &lt; u;
     else  // T is unsigned
       return u &lt; 0 ? false : t &lt; UU(u);
  }
};</pre>

<p>Now let us discuss if <code>StrictWeakOrdering&lt;MathematicalLess, unsigned, int&gt;</code>. Firstly, the <code>unsigned</code> and
   <code>int</code> types has a common type: <code>std::common_type_t&lt;unsigned, int&gt;</code> is <code>unsigned</code>. Secondly
   <code>MathematicalLess</code> can be invoked with any combination of objects of type either <code>int</code> or </code>unsigned</code>.
   That means that we are satisfying our syntactic requirements.</code>

<p>However, if we consider following semantic requirement that invocation of relation <code>r(a, b)</code> is always equivalent to
   invocation <code>r(C(a), C(b))</code>, where <code>C</code> is common reference type.
   In case of our functor, that requires that <code>MathematicalLess{}(-1, 1u)</code>, is required to return the same value
   as <code>MathematicalLess{}(unsigned(-1), unsigned(1u))</code>, which is equal to <code>false</code>. However, by the design
   of <code>MathematicalLess</code> the result shall be true.</code>.</p>

<p>Note that this problem is not-fixable without introducing opaque typedefs, as user is not allowed to change the common type
   for built-in types.</p> 

<h2><a name="design">4. Design Decisions</a></h2>

<h3><a name="design.requiring-same-type">4.1. Requiring homogeneous invocation</a></h3>

<p>Even after removal of the <code>CommonReference</code> requirement for the <code>StrictWeakOrdering</code>, this concept will be more strict 
   that the minimal STL1 requirements - the <code>StrictWeakOrdering&lt;F, T, U&gt;</code> requires <code>F</code> requires that <code>F</code>
   is both invocable with combination of types (<code>Predicate&lt;F, T, U&gt;</code> and <code>Predicate&lt;F, U, T&gt;</code>), but also two
   object of the same type (<code>Predicate&lt;F, T, T&gt;</code> and <code>Predicate&lt;F, U, U&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>To illustrate, if we consider and reduced an version of the <code>NameLess</code> comparator:</p>
<pre>struct ReducedNameLess
{
   bool operator()(Employee const&amp; lhs, std::string_view rhs) const
   { return lhs.name &lt; rhs; }

   bool operator()(std::string_view lhs, Employee const&amp; rhs) const
   { return lhs &lt; rhs.name; }
};</pre>
<p>The following invocation compiles and gives correct result:</p>
<pre>std::equal_range(ve.begin(), ve.end(), "Kowalski"sv, ReducedNameLess{});</pre>
<p>as implementation of <code>std::equal_range</code> does not need to invoke supplied comparator on two objects of same collection.
   However, even with the proposed relaxation of the <code>StrictWeakOrdering</code> concept, the range version of above invocation,
   will still fail to compile:</p>
<pre>std::ranges::equal_range(ve.begin(), ve.end(), "Kowalski"sv, ReducedNameLess{});</pre>

<p>The above additional requirement are required to fulfill the goal of <em>soudness</em> of the design - we explicitly require
   that the requirements of the invoked algorithm could be checkable as the runtime. In case of the <code>equal_range(range, value,
   comp)</code>, we require that the:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>comp</code> model <em>weak ordering</em> over sum of elements in <code>range</code> and <code>value</code>,</li>
  <li><code>range</code> elements is sorted in order defined by the <code>comp</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second requirement can be checked, by simply checking if <code>is_sorted(range.begin(), range.end(), comp)</code> is true,
   which impose that <code>comp</code> can be invoked with two elements of supplied range. For the first requirement
   we need to verify if axioms described in section <a href="motivation.sound">3.2. Mathematical soundness</a> of this paper - 
   this validation requires <code>comp</code> to be invocable with any combination of types.</code>


<h3><a name="design.totally_ordered_with">4.2. No relaxation for <code>StrictTotallyOrderedWith&lt;T, U&gt;</code></a></h3>

<p>The <code>StrictTotallyOrderedWith&lt;T, U&gt;</code> concept may be viewed as the special case of the
   <code>StrictWeakOrdering&lt;std::less&lt;&gt;, T, U&gt;</code>, where the ordering is represented as <code>operator&lt;</code>
   instead of custom comparator. With such view we may want to apply similar relaxation of requirement for
   this concept.</p>

<p>However, the underlying semantics of the <code>StrictTotallyOrderedWith&lt;T, U&gt;</code> is different 
   than the <code>StrictWeakOrdering&lt;std::less&lt;&gt;, T, U</code>, as it is meant to represent an
   <em>strong order</em> - in contrast to the <em>weak ordering</em> for the <em>strong ordering</em>, 
   if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are not ordered (<code>!(a &lt; b) &amp;&amp; !(b &lt; a)</code>),
   then they are the same <code>a == b</code> (representing the same value). 
   To satisfy above requirements, the objects of different types needs to represent the same underlying
   entities - i.e. there is common type for them in the underlying domain.</p>

<p>However, in some implementing an representation of such common type, may be task that is orders of
   magnitude harder than the implementing comparator itself. To illustrate lets as consider the 
   comparison between class representing variable length integer <code>wide_int</code> <code>i</code> and floating
   point value <code>double</code> <code>d</code>. The implementation of such comparison may work as follow:</p>
<ul>
   <li>represent integral part of <code>std::floor(d)</code> as <code>wide_int</code> <code>di</code>,</li>
   <li>if <code>i != di</code>, return <code>i &lt; di</code>,</li>
   <li>otherwise, return <code>false</code>, if fraction part of <code>d</code> (<code>d - std::floor(d)</code>) is non-zero.</li>
</ul> 
<p>In contrast providing an <code>common_type&lt;wide_int, double&gt;</code> would require the user
   to implement class representing arbitrary precision floating point numbers.</code>

<p>The changes proposed in this paper allow to mitigate the problem, by implementing the above compassion
   custom comparison function. Note that without proposed relaxation of <code>StrictWeakOrdering</code>
   requirements, the burden of implementing such common type would be unavoidable.</p>

<p>Note that the definition provided in [concept.strictweakorder] Concept <code>StrictWeakOrder</code>, does not need to updated
   as it does not rely on the existence of <code>common_reference_t&lt;const remove_reference_t&lt;T&gt;&amp;, const remove_reference_t&lt;U&gt;&amp;&gt;</code>
   in any way.</p>
